# playkids-onboarding

Welcome to the PlayKids Platforms Team! If you are reading this you should be excited to learn a lot, show your skills and helps us build great software for our customers.

To help you get ready to contribute to PlayKids, we are tasking you with an entire new project that you'll have to build from the ground up defining its architecture, build process, code style, UX and everything else. Fear not! This is just a dummy project to get you used to our workflow and tools.

Feel free to do whatever you want to fulfill the project's requirements. This is how we work on every project and we tend to challenge ourselves by learning new technologies and going the extra mile to impress our teammates and customers.

Let's get started making a nice project called **Playkids Catalog**!

# Playkids Catalog

## Project Description
Your task is to build a catalog app which performs some operations such as listing, filtering and searching contents over playkid's content tree. To do so, let's put all the heavy work to a SDK so we can use it into your app and somebody else's.

Your app does not need to look fancy, lets focus on this primary goals:

* Adhering to good OO guidance practices
* Uses data-structures and algoritmns wisely to enhance your work
* Ensure your code is covered by unit tests
* Should be user-friendly (UX)

Your project should be:

### Phase 1
* Able to acquire playkid's content tree (JSON file) from a external web service.
* Parses all the content tree and persist into a database.

### Phase 2
* Perform some operations over database, sush as:
  * List all available contents.
  * Search a particular content by properties e.q (name, tag).
  * Filter contents by properties e.q (age, segment).
* Show the operation's results

### Phase 3
* Able to change the content tree region to acquire new content tree.
* Only shows contents by its own region.

## Technical Requirements
 The project must be built using your desirable program language and frameworks according to the platform (Android, iOS, Web). 

 You must build a test suite for the parts of your software that you deem essential.

 All actions performed on the system must log events with information about who made the action, when and what was done.

 ## Technology stack suggestions
In order to best use this project for your training, we suggest that you use some of the programming languages, frameworks, libraries and tools that we use on most of our other projects:
